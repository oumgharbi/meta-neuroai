    """CHB-MIT: EEG recordings during seizure monitoring in pediatric participants.

    This BIDS-formatted version of the CHB-MIT Scalp EEG Database contains long-term
    EEG monitoring recordings from pediatric participants (ages 1.5-22) with
    intractable seizures at Children's Hospital Boston. Participants were monitored
    for up to several days following withdrawal of anti-seizure medication to
    characterize seizures and assess candidacy for surgical intervention.

    Experimental Design:
        - EEG recordings (18-channel, 256 Hz)
        - 23 participants (22 unique individuals; 5 males, 17 females)
        - Multiple recording sessions with varying numbers of runs per participant
        - Paradigm: continuous seizure monitoring
            * Long-term EEG recording during anti-seizure medication withdrawal
            * Seizure events annotated in BIDS events files

    Notes:
        - Subject 21 in the original dataset was consolidated as a second session
          of subject 01 in this BIDS version.
        - The original dataset was collected at Children's Hospital Boston and
          published on PhysioNet (doi: 10.13026/C2K01R).
        - Channel count varies across participants; 18 channels reflects the
          reference timeline (timeline_index 144).
