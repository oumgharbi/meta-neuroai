"""Neuraltrain custom configuration for LaBraM.

Includes the following adaptations:

* Channel name remapping via an explicit user-provided mapping.
* Dynamic channel resolution at forward time using ``channel_positions`` to
  detect which channels are valid per sample.
* Temporal-embedding adaptation so pretrained weights can be reused with a
  different ``n_times`` (truncation for fewer patches, linear interpolation
  for more patches than the pretrained model).

    """Wraps a braindecode ``Labram`` to resolve channel names at forward time.

    Channel handling is precomputed in union-channel order:

    * ``_labram_names`` -- the LaBraM-cased name to forward to the inner
      model for each union channel (channels with no LaBraM mapping fall
      back to their original name; see ``_known_mask`` below for how those
      are then filtered out before reaching braindecode).
    * ``_positionless_mask`` -- a boolean buffer marking channels that have
      a valid LaBraM mapping but no montage position (bipolar derivations
      resolved via anode fallback, or channels added via an explicit
      ``channel_mapping``).  These are kept regardless of their per-sample
      ``channel_positions`` row, so e.g. SleepEDF's bipolar ``Fpz-Cz`` or
      Geodesic E-numbers reach LaBraM even when ``set_montage`` could not
      assign them coordinates.
    * ``_known_mask`` -- a boolean buffer marking channels whose
      wrapper-resolved name is in :data:`LABRAM_CHANNEL_ORDER`
      (case-insensitively).  Channels that fail this check (e.g. unmapped
      EGI ``E5``, ``E7``, ...) are filtered out entirely so braindecode
      never sees them.  This matters because braindecode dropped its
      ``on_unknown_chs`` parameter in ``>=1.5`` and now hard-raises a
      ``ValueError`` on the first unknown name; doing the filtering here
      keeps the wrapper's behaviour ("warn-and-drop") stable across
      braindecode versions.

    At forward time the per-sample position mask is OR-combined with
    ``_positionless_mask``, AND-combined with ``_known_mask``, then
    intersected across the batch (LaBraM's ``ch_names`` is per-batch, so
    heterogeneous batches fall back to the channels valid in every sample).

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : nn.Module
        The braindecode ``Labram`` model instance.
    union_ch_names : list of str
        Ordered channel names from the dataset union (matching the channel
        dimension of the input tensor).
    ch_name_to_labram : dict mapping str to str
        Mapping from dataset channel names to LaBraM channel names, as
        returned by :meth:`NtLabram._build_channel_remapping`.  Channels not
        in this dict are dropped by the wrapper before the inner model
        sees them.
    positionless_ch_names : set of str, optional
        Subset of ``ch_name_to_labram`` keys whose channels are not expected
        to carry montage positions.  Defaults to an empty set.
    pad_right, truncate_right : int
        Time-axis padding/truncation applied just before the inner model
