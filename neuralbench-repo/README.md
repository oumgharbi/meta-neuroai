</p>

`neuralbench` is a unified framework to benchmark **NeuroAI models**. It is designed for evaluating pretrained or randomly initialized models on a diverse suite of downstream tasks for brain modeling -- not for pretraining itself. It supports multiple neuroimaging devices -- **EEG**, **MEG**, **fMRI**, and **EMG** -- with more tasks and devices to come.

**Examples**:
```console
neuralbench eeg audiovisual_stimulus -m eegnet   # EEG audiovisual stimulus classification with EEGNet
```

See `neuralbench` in the [documentation](https://facebookresearch.github.io/neuroai/).

## Installation

Install from PyPI:
```console
pip install neuralbench
```

Or install from source (e.g. for development):
```console
cd neuralbench-repo
pip install -e .
```

## Quick start

As an example, let's run the audiovisual stimulus classification task with the default model from EEG. This task uses the [MNE sample dataset](https://mne.tools/stable/documentation/datasets.html#sample), which is small (~1.5 GB) and can be downloaded quickly. We use it both as a sanity-check task and as a probe of model behaviour in very-low-data regimes (a single subject, 288 trials, 4-class classification).

When you first run `neuralbench`, you will be prompted to configure paths for data (`DATA_DIR`), cache (`CACHE_DIR`) and results (`SAVE_DIR`). The configuration will be saved to `~/.neuralbench/config.json` by default. Set `NEURALBENCH_CONFIG=/path/to/config.json` to override this location (useful on shared machines or in CI; see [Custom config location](https://facebookresearch.github.io/neuroai/neuralbench/install.html#custom-config-location)).
If using `Weights & Biases`, see [this section](#weights--biases-setup) for setup instructions.

Evaluate a model on a downstream task in three commands:

```console
neuralbench eeg audiovisual_stimulus --download   # 1. Download the data (here, the Mne2013SampleEeg study)
neuralbench eeg audiovisual_stimulus --prepare    # 2. Prepare cache (preprocessed data and targets)
neuralbench eeg audiovisual_stimulus              # 3. Run the full grid
```

Steps 2 and 3 dispatch to SLURM when it is auto-detected on your machine; step 3 additionally requires `SLURM_PARTITION` to be set in your neuralbench config. Pass `--debug` to either step to force local execution. To run the full config locally (no SLURM, full epochs and batches), set `"CLUSTER": null` in `~/.neuralbench/config.json` (the default `"auto"` uses SLURM when available; `"slurm"` always submits). Step 2 is mostly useful for larger datasets that benefit from parallel preprocessing with SLURM, and is not strictly necessary for `audiovisual_stimulus`. Add `--debug` to any command for a fast local sanity-check run with a subsampled dataset and a limited number of epochs:

```console
neuralbench eeg audiovisual_stimulus --debug      # Local validation run
```

By default, experiments use the EEGNet architecture[^1]; use `-m <model>` to swap models.

Results can be visualized on `Weights & Biases`, or aggregated locally using `--plot-cached` (see the [Visualizing Results](https://facebookresearch.github.io/neuroai/neuralbench/auto_examples/results/plot_visualize_results.html) tutorial).

> [!TIP]
> See the full [quickstart tutorial](https://facebookresearch.github.io/neuroai/neuralbench/auto_examples/quickstart/01_run_first_task.html) for a walkthrough of the CLI, config system, and model selection.

The same workflow applies to **MEG**, **fMRI**, and **EMG** tasks -- just swap the device and task name:
```console
neuralbench meg typing --debug          # MEG keystroke classification in debug mode
neuralbench fmri image --debug          # fMRI image retrieval in debug mode
neuralbench emg typing -m emg2qwerty --debug   # EMG → keystroke CTC decoding (emg2qwerty)
```

## Running the full EEG benchmark

To run all 36 EEG tasks end-to-end:

```console
neuralbench eeg all --download          # 1. Download all datasets (~3.3 TB)
neuralbench eeg all --prepare           # 2. Build preprocessing cache (~35 GB)
neuralbench eeg all                     # 3. Run all 36 tasks
```

Use `-m all_classic`, `-m all_fm`, or `-m all_classic all_fm` to evaluate across all 8 task-specific EEG models, all 6 EEG foundation models, or all 14 EEG models respectively.

See the [full EEG benchmark guide](https://facebookresearch.github.io/neuroai/neuralbench/full_benchmark.html) for prerequisites, resource requirements (~3.3 TB disk, 1 GPU with 32 GB VRAM per job), dataset variant options, and computational considerations.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A handful of datasets cannot be fetched automatically and require a one-time manual step (creating an account, accepting a license agreement, or submitting an application form). The affected tasks are `pathology`, `artifact`, and `clinical_event` (TUH EEG Corpus); `image` and `meg/image` (THINGS-images); `emotion` (FACED on Synapse); `video` (SEED-DV); `fmri/image` (NSD); `motor_imagery` and `mental_arithmetic` (Shin2017OpenA and Shin2017OpenB); and `speech` (Brennan2019 on Deep Blue Data: the legacy `urlretrieve`-based downloader is currently blocked by Cloudflare's bot challenge, so the v1 files must be fetched manually via Globus until upstream restores anonymous HTTP access). See the [Datasets requiring manual download](https://facebookresearch.github.io/neuroai/neuralbench/full_benchmark.html#manual-download-datasets) section of the benchmark guide for the exact steps for each one.

## Weights & Biases setup

If using Weights & Biases for experiment tracking, first set the relevant environment variable:
```console
export WANDB_API_KEY=your_wandb_api_key
```

Then configure the `WandbLoggerConfig` (from `neuraltrain.utils`) accordingly, e.g., by setting the `host`, `name`, `group` and `entity` fields to those of your project.

Leave `WANDB_HOST=""` blank in your neuralbench config to disable W&B logging entirely; results are still written to `SAVE_DIR` and remain accessible via `--plot-cached`.

## Benchmark suites

NeuralBench packages its tasks and datasets into named, versioned evaluation suites. Any reported result should cite a concrete suite, e.g. `NeuralBench-EEG-Core v1.0`. The unqualified name **NeuralBench** refers to the framework only.

**Naming scheme**: `NeuralBench-<Modality>-<Variant> v<Major>.<Minor>`

- **Modality** — `EEG`, `MEG`, `fMRI` (one version history per modality).
- **Variant** — `Core` (one dataset per task; broad coverage across paradigms) or `Full` (every dataset registered for each task; reveals within-task variability). `Full` is always a strict superset of `Core` at the same version.
- **Version** — semver-style tag for the frozen task/dataset/split specification. Minor bumps are additive and back-comparable; major bumps are breaking.

**Current release**:

- **NeuralBench-EEG-Core v1.0** — one dataset × all EEG tasks.
- **NeuralBench-EEG-Full v1.0** — all datasets × all EEG tasks.

## Available Tasks

The following tasks are available in neuralbench, organized by device:

**EEG** (36 tasks): `age`, `artifact`, `audiovisual_stimulus`, `clinical_event`, `cvep`, `dementia_diagnosis`, `depression_diagnosis`, `emotion`, `ern`, `image`, `lrp`, `mental_arithmetic`, `mental_imagery`, `mental_workload`, `mismatch_negativity`, `motor_execution`, `motor_imagery`, `n170`, `n2pc`, `n400`, `p3`, `parkinsons_diagnosis`, `pathology`, `psychopathology`, `reaction_time`, `schizophrenia_diagnosis`, `seizure`, `sentence`, `sex`, `sleep_arousal`, `sleep_stage`, `speech`, `ssvep`, `typing`, `video`, `word`
